# 🧾 osTicket: Ticket Lifecycle Simulation

> In this lab, I worked through the **full lifecycle of a support ticket** using osTicket — playing the role of the Admin, Help Desk Agent, and End User. This allowed me to understand how tickets are submitted, routed, prioritized, escalated, and resolved in a real-world IT support environment.

---

## 🧪 Roles Simulated
- 👨‍💼 **Admin** – Full access to system configuration and agent management
- 👷‍♂️ **Agent (Jane & John)** – Responsible for handling, updating, and resolving tickets
- 🙋‍♂️ **End Users (Karen & Ken)** – Submitted requests/issues through the portal

---

## 📋 Ticket Workflow Checklist

| ✅ | Task Description |
|----|------------------|
| ✔️ | Created **critical outage** ticket as an end user ("entire mobile banking system down") |
| ✔️ | Logged in as Agent (John) and reviewed ticket properties (SLA, priority, assigned dept.) |
| ✔️ | Assigned `Sev-A` SLA (1 hour, 24/7) and moved ticket to `Online Banking` department |
| ✔️ | Re-logged in as Jane and completed the resolution process |
| ✔️ | Repeated the process with additional tickets: `Adobe upgrade issue`, `CFO's laptop failure` |
| ✔️ | Tested ticket access restrictions by assigning to different depts. and observing permission changes |
| ✔️ | Demonstrated escalation logic and updated ticket statuses across user types |

## 🧠 Insights & Takeaways

🧩 **Understanding the Lifecycle**  
> Experiencing the ticket from all 3 roles helped me understand internal processes, permission-based visibility, and the importance of clear communication.

🔧 **Why This Matters**  
> Efficient ticket triage and handling ensures faster resolution, improved service, and stronger accountability across departments.

📊 **Real-World Parallel**  
> Helpdesk tools like osTicket are the backbone of IT support operations in companies — this lab mirrors that environment closely.
